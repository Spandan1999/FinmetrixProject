This project is the main project which I have created for Finmetrix. After establishing the connection with mysql server, creating database and inserting the data to the database(excel_to_databse), this tool has been created.
This is an GUI program which is made by using python tkinter module.
This project contain two interfaces
1.> for the data entry employee:-
	In this part the employee searches a customer id list which they have been provided by the 	manager. The Id then searches the database an displayes customer information. Then The 	employees are tasked to call the customer from the phone number displayed from the database. 	They fill the empty remark column after talking to the customer.
	(please refer to the documented code of NewMain.py for understanding how this software is 	communicating with the database and returning results)
2.> for the Admin or manager:- This program is used by the manager to track the work progress and add new work.
	(please refer to the documented code of Admin.py for understanding how this software is 	communicating with the database and returning results)
